# **Business and Data Understanding**

* Newcastle University in conjunction with Future Learn 

* Business questions


    How many students enrolled per run?

    Where are the majority of students situated?

    What are the student demographics and who should be targeted for future marketing perspectives?

* Cyber Security:Safety at Home, Online, in Life Dataset:


    Enrolments (7 files)

# **How many students enrolled per run?**

```{r number_of_students, echo=FALSE}
